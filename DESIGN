Ships themselves:
- class
- name
- heading
- guns
- total hull (unnecessary? 10xClass)
- total rigging (unnecessary? 5xClass)
- current hull hits remaining
- current rigging hits remaining



- crew?
- captain?



CONVERSION FROM LEGO
- maximum crew: limited in Lego only by the maximum number of models that can be piled on the ship. we should probably limit it.


- or do we just go real-time, instead of following the movement orders system and such? that seems somewhat more attractive, though it requires a more complex change to the system.



I say we turn it loose:
- real-time
  - pausing?
- 360-degree courses with smooth (but nonlinear) wind power curves
- 360-degree winds, minor shifts by the second, major shifts over time
  - minutes? tens of minutes? how fast-paced is this game?
- speed can be controlled by ordering:
  - full sail -- best possible speed
  - 3/4 sail
  - 1/2 sail
  - 1/4 sail
  - steerage -- enough forward motion to hold course.
  - furled -- sail-less, ship gradually rotates into the wind
    - also drifts with the wind.
- cannons
  - mounted port, starboard, fore and aft.
  - various weights?
  - how much rotation do we give broadside guns?
    - lower-deck guns very little, upper deck somewhat more?
  - cannonball flight -- realistic speeds?
  - do we track ammunition? (powder and balls)
- crew
  - boarding actions? maybe simulated only. hard to interact with that.
  - alloting crewman is a key part of captaincy.
    - repair teams
    - firing guns
    - manning the sails
      - base amount required to make each speed
      - some fraction more (20%?) required temporarily to change sail setting
    - conning the ship -- small fixed amount, required for anything but furled sails
    - lookouts -- limited, purchasable number of spyglasses?
      - more lookouts increases chance of spotting distant ships.
      - within a certain range ships are obviously visible even with no lookouts.

- navigation
  - simply at-sea combat needn't worry much about this
  - adding distance sailing, ports, etc., or even just an island to hide behind, would require more navigational information.


- interface
  - textual initially. a GUI (or web/AJAX?) interface is possible later.

- multiplayer
  - a must-have, not least because I don't want to write an AI for a combat system this complex.
  - player vs. player, co-op, whatever scenario we can devise. with no AIs, a scenario is basically the ships, their positions and loadouts. the players control the rest.

- AI
  - obviously writable, see Sid Meier's Pirates, Dangerous Waters
  - but it's a big task, and far down the list of priorities.


IMPLEMENTATION

The sequence of feature implementation I imagine is as follows:
- basic data structures
- multiplayer infrastructure 
  - dumb clients... perhaps even just telnet itself? the cheap start anyway.
- sailing back-end
- sailing front-end
- firing guns back-end
- firing guns front-end
- damage system -- guns won't do anything at first :P
- crew control interface
- help system



INTERFACE
- mostly MUD-like: "fire stbd" "reload stbd" "prepare port" "fire port"
- sailing: "port to 340" "right by 30"
- can give sail settings evocative names:
  - "sails full"
  - "sails drawn"
  - "sails half"
  - "sails light"
  - "steerage"
  - "sails furled"
- server-side responses to the ordering player can be authentic-sounding crew reports:
  - "turn aport to 340, aye!"
- other players with lookouts' eyes on an opponent see some reports from the lookouts
  - "Cap'n, the Amber Mary be turnin' to port!"
  - "The Amber Mary is making full sails."
  - "INCOMING TO PORT!" for coming shots. what's a pirately word for "incoming"?
  - "help" for command list, "help <command>" for more detail


REALISM
- biggest factors are as in DW:
  - time scale
    - weapon reload times
    - shot flight times
    - time to make or furl sails
    - turn rates
    - travel speeds
  - spotting distances
    - more or less detailed (or accurate?) reports of enemy activity at different ranges
    - maximum distance to horizon, spotting chance growing with decreasing range
    - once a ship has been sighted, as long as one crewman per opponent remains on lookout duty, it won't be lost until she dips fully behind the horizon.
    - only lookouts not dedicated to following a particular vessel are searching.
      - no searcher means no spotting until she reaches the very small range that makes her obvious to everyone aboard.
  - communication
    - how fast and how frequently can friendly and opposing captains communicate?
    - when was semaphore and signaling lights invented? could they send arbitrary text?
    - or was it just a small language of signals via flags/lights?

  - night vs. day? not many pirate battles were fought at night, too hard to see other vessels, wind too calm. assuming always day for now seems reasonable.
  - wind direction and strength, and their functions with time.
